  <b> Welcome, and thank you for taking part in our study! </b> </p>

  
  <p align="justify"> 
This study investigates how a first and second language influence the processing of a third language in a multilingual speaker. The results of this study can contribute to fields such as language acquisition or the diagnostic of language disorders.
    For this reason, we ask you to take the experiment seriously, to follow carefully the instructions and to remain concentrated. 
    You will be compensated for your participation! Please bear in mind that this experiment needs to be completed on a computer. Cellphones or tablets are not adequate for the tasks of the experiment.
</p>

<br>

<p align="center" ;="" style="font-size:110%;color:coral;"> <b>
Please read carefully the following points before you start</b>
</p> 

<p align="justify" ;="" style="font-size:110%; font-family:lucidagrande;"> <b> 1. Requirements for participation </b> </p>
<p>We have to restrict our investigation to a specific type of multilingual speaker, so please only continue with this experiment if you fulfill either of the following requirements: </p>

  <p align="justify"> (a) If you are a native speaker of English, and have an intermediate* level of both languages, Spanish and German. 
  You should have either no knowledge, or at most a very basic level of any other foreign language that is not Spanish or German.  </p>
<p align="justify"> (b) If you are a native speaker of Spanish, and have an intermediate* level of both languages, English and German. 
You should have either no knowledge, or at most a very basic level of any other foreign language that is not English or German.
</p>
<p>*<i>An intermediate level allows you to understand the main ideas of a complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, and to interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity with native speakers without much strain for either party.</i>


</p><p align="justify" ;="" style="font-size:110%; font-family:lucidagrande;"> 
<b> 2. Who is  not a candidate for the experiment?</b> 
</p><ul> 
<li> native speakers of other languages (if you started learning English after age 3, you do not fit the English native profile for this experiment; if you started learning Spanish after age 3, you do not fit the Spanish native speaker profile for this experiment); </li>
<li>if you learned two languages simultaneously since birth, e.g.:
<ul><li> both Spanish and English simultaneously since birth; </li>
<li> both English and German simultaneously since birth; </li>
<li> both Spanish and German simultaneously since birth.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p></p>


  <p align="justify" ;="" style="font-size:110%; font-family:lucidagrande;"> 
  <b> 3. Structure of the experiment </b></p>
<p>You will need between <b> 45 and 55 minutes </b> to complete all tasks in this experiment. The experiment consists of:</p>
<p> (a) A questionnaire about your linguistic background and personal information (5 minutes) </p>
<p> (b) The experimental part itself </p>
<ol> <li> A sentence judgment task in German (10 minutes)</li>
<li> A second sentence judgment task in German (10 minutes)</li>
<li> A multiple-choice questionnaire in German (10 minutes)</li>
<li> A vocabulary checklist in German (8 minutes)</li>
<li> A German proficiency test (10 minutes) </li>
</ol>

<p align="justify" ;="" style="font-size:110%; font-family:lucidagrande;"> 
<b> 4. The experiment settings and time</b> </p>
<p> Please make sure that you are absolutely free during the 55 minutes of the experiment. You should be in a quiet room with no distractions (e.g. distractions such as a TV, radio, or phone; other people in the room, or other internet tabs and computer programmes open). We will indicate at which point you can take a break. 
You should maximise this experiment window now, and close all other tabs.</p> 

<p align="justify" ;="" style="font-size:110%;font-family:lucidagrande;"> 
<b> 5. Reward for participation </b> </p>
<p> You will be given a personal code after you have completed the experiment. In order to receive the 5 Euro expense allowance for your participation, you should send the code and your bank details to the address we will provide you with at the end of the experiment.</p>
